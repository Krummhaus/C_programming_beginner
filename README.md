Is originally Udemy course named:<br/>

## **"C Programming For Beginners"**<br/>
Lector: Jason Fedin<br/>

Started for study purposes and a better understanding of<br/>the python language and its C impelmentation (C - Python).<br/><br/>

Thumbs up for Jason Fedin.<br/>

I really appreciate the explanation of the VS Code<br/>
and Code Blocks instalation and setting things up for Windows and Linux.<br/>

C code is named by number of chapters.<br/>
it can serve as an aid and memory support (code snippets).
